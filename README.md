  - Steep learning curve due to its technical nature.

### **Why Build a Custom Tool?**
While these tools offer powerful capabilities in their respective domains, none of them fully address the specific needs we’ve identified. Our custom tool aims to:
- **Provide more flexibility** in database cloning, backup, and management.
- **Reduce costs** by offering an affordable, targeted solution for smaller teams or specific use cases.
- **Simplify user experience** to avoid the complexity found in enterprise-grade solutions like Commvault and Optim.

Our goal is to offer a lightweight, scalable solution that balances functionality with ease of use, particularly for teams looking for a focused, cost-effective alternative to existing tools.
